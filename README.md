this repository is a collection of packages that were made because any existing packages did not meet my requirements or otherwise sucked.
basically a collection of utilities for my own use, though feel free to use, contribute and leave feedback if you find them any useful :>

> [!WARNING]
> everything in this repo is very much a wip and is not really ready for public use
